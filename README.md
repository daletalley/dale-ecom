# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description
This project demonstrates my understanding of working on the back end of an application. It showcases the configuration of a working Express.js API and the use of Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The project also includes schema and seed commands to populate fake data in the application's database. The API routes include GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST routes for different tables of data, which can be tested in Insomnia to view their functionality.

## Installation
To connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database, the following packages are required:
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
- [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

Additionally, the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package is used to store sensitive data using environment variables.

## Usage
This project serves as an example of a back-end application. It can be used as a reference to understand how Sequelize is used to connect to a MySQL database, create tables, seed fake data, and implement CRUD operations. The provided routes can be tested in Insomnia for further learning.
